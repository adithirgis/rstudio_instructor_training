## Learner Persona 

### Geetha 

- Geetha is a recent ecology graduate and currently an independent ecologist who wants to do analysis and field work on her own. 
- She works with excel, other interface tools usually but now wants to shift to R since she has seen her peers working with R and also seen R skills required / preferred in job opportunities. 
- She googles all her questions, relies on the open source community, and twitter. She then understands it and implements it on her own, hence is familiar with ggplot, tidyverse, and sf, but is still not comfortable to write code from scratch on her own. 
- She has a solid foundation of field knowledge. 
- She is a super mom with two kids and goes on field work, so has little time to spend on extra learning.
