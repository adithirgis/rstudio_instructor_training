## Formative Assessment 


## Learner Persona 

### Meet Geetha 

- Geetha is a recent ecology graduate and currently an independent ecologist who wants to do analysis and field work on her own. 
- She has a solid foundation of the field knowledge and has satisfactory statistical knowledge. She works with Excel, and Prism (interface tools). 
- She searches all her questions on the internet, relies on the open source community, blog posts, and twitter. She then understands the code and tries to implement. She is familiar with packages like `ggplot`, `tidyverse`, and `rmarkdown`, but is still not comfortable to write code from scratch on her own. 
- She wants to shift to R since she has seen her peers working with R and has also seen R skills required / preferred in job descriptions. 
- She is a super mom with two kids and goes on field work, so has little time to spend on extra learning.
